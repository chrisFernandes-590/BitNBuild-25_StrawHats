## 📌 Project Abstract  
Filing taxes and managing personal finances in India is often **time-consuming, complex, and fragmented**. Many individuals rely on spreadsheets or costly third-party services, missing out on **legal tax-saving opportunities** and struggling to maintain a healthy **CIBIL score**.  

**TaxWise** is an **AI-powered personal finance platform** designed to simplify this process.  

- Users can **upload bank/credit card statements or CSVs**, which are automatically cleaned and categorized.  
- An **AI-driven tax optimization engine** computes tax liability, applies deductions (80C, 80D, 80G, etc.), and compares **Old vs New Regimes** to maximize legal savings.  
- A **CIBIL Score Advisor** analyzes financial behavior, identifies risks, and provides actionable recommendations—including “what-if” scenario simulations.  
- The platform offers an **interactive dashboard** with spending insights, tax projections, and CIBIL health, along with **downloadable reports** for financial planning.  

🚀 In short: **TaxWise empowers Indian users to make smarter financial decisions with minimal effort.**
